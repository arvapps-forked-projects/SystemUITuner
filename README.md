# Android System UI Tuner
A simple Android app to launch System UI Tuner.

First introduced in Android 6.0 (Marshmallow), Google included a hidden menu in stock Android with experimental options called System UI Tuner.

The option to launch System UI Tuner in Android version 9 and newer has been removed by Google, but the utility still exists in the system. This application will launch it if present.
